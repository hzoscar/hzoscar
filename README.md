# 👋 Hi, I'm Oscar!

I'm a data enthusiast on a journey to decode the mysteries of the data universe 🚀. Fluent in three languages—Spanish 🇪🇸, Italian 🇮🇹, and English (in progress) 🇬🇧—I love turning numbers into meaningful insights.

<!-- About Me Section -->
## 📊 Data Alchemist

- As an economist with a Bachelor's degree from the Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieria Julio Garavito, I've mastered the art of economics, mathematics, statistics, and Excel, forging a solid foundation for my data-driven adventures.

- My trusty data toolbox, which I acquired through:
  1. The rigorous data analytics certification program at La Escuela Británica de Artes y Tecnología (it took me 1 year!) and,
  2. the hands-on Data science boot camp that I'm currently taking at Alura Latam 
 equips me with the skills to transform raw data into actionable insights.


- 🎓 Recently, I have started a Master's degree in data science at Rome Business School 🇮🇹. This new chapter promises to be an exploration of data's limitless possibilities.
