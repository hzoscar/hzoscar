# 👋 Hi, I'm Oscar!

I'm a data enthusiast on a journey to decode the mysteries of the data universe 🚀. Fluent in three languages—Spanish 🇪🇸, Italian 🇮🇹, and English 🇬🇧—I love turning numbers into meaningful insights.

<!-- About Me Section -->
## 📊 Data Alchemist

- As an economist with a Bachelor's degree from the Escuela Colombiana de Ingenieria Julio Garavito, I've mastered the art of economics, mathematics, statistics, and Excel, forging a solid foundation for my data-driven adventures.

- My trusty data toolbox, which I acquired through the rigorous data analytics certification program at La Escuela Británica de Artes y Tecnología (it takes me 1 year!), equips me with the skills to transform raw data into actionable insights.

- 🎓 Soon, I'll embark on an expedition into the world of data science as I start my Master's degree at the Rome Business School 🇮🇹. This new chapter promises to be an exploration of data's limitless possibilities.
